PL/SQL DATABASE DOCUMENTATION

I am designing a database for a school, with four four different tables. We are having a table for Students, Courses, Teachers, Enrollments and CourseTeachers.
I am proceeding below with clearly showing the step by step the screenshots of all my SQL queries, results, and my conceptual diagram.

CREATING TABLES;

Showing it below, SQL developer makes it easy to view the conceptual schema by creating it and bringing out the relations according to the specified referential integrity constraints while creating those tables.

INSERTING DATA IN THE TABLES THAT WERE CREATED EARLIER. 
Below this is showing the queries for inseting values and the results after.

For more clarity, I will display what has been inserted into our table by using select query. “Select * from tablename;” Here the tablename is “Students”
![all students](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/034350a4-8480-4906-bc73-26e04f2f9e5e)

 I will display what has been inserted into our table by using select query. “Select * from tablename;” Here the tablename is “Courses”
 ![all courses](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33ff75e0-8e46-4fa2-99e6-d8ef8559bdc0)

 I will display what has been inserted into our table by using select query. “Select * from tablename;” Here the tablename is “Teachers”
![all teachers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f418eb92-7576-46a8-858a-ac02ca3288fe)

 I will display what has been inserted into our table by using select query. “Select * from tablename;” Here the tablename is “Enrollments”
![all enrollments](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3e8babd-f4bb-44b2-babb-fc5022008f7f)


As seen below, all the data that we had has been updated accurately.

PERFORMING JOINS AND SUBQUERIES
I am going to show the query results one by one for a clear observation, where the highlighted queries are the ones that correspond to the output shown
